<p align="center"><IMG SRC="HSM_Photos/Schoolhouse2.jpg" width="70%"></p>
<p align="left">In 1836, Mr. Charles Pease donated land across from his homestead to build a one room stone schoolhouse. It was 30'x24' with walls 18" thick. It cost $225 to build. In 1865, it cost $12.50 to supply the fuel for the winter, which was ten cords of hard wood, cut to stove length. It was the teacher's job to start the fire.
<br>In 1868, after heated discussion about whether to repair the old schoolhouse or build a new one, the little stone schoolhouse was torn down and replaced by a brick one. On January 20, 1868, it was resolved by Marvin Gurnee that "we exchange the old site for a new one 30 rods to the south of the present location." Mr. Pease requested that the new school be located 30 rods (1 rod = 16.5 feet) south, so he would not be disturbed by the children's noise. On October 12, 1869, a report read at the school meeting stated that the cost of the new school was $755.50. The stove and pipe cost $15.50. There was a remainder of $7.50 which was used to grade the school grounds. The vestibule was added later, it includes a girls out house, the boys still had to go outside. It is believed the wood shed was added about the same time.
